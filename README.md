\# Semester Academics

This python program is an interactive college student game. In which the user inputs their semester profile and goes through the game, changing their inputs as follows. At the end your GPA, study hours, social points, and stress level determines your ending. 



\# Concepts Used

Throughout the game, the concepts below are used as follows:



\- \*if / elif / else statements\* are used throughout the whole game

\- \*\*Comparison Operators\*\* ('<', '>', '<=', '>=', '==', '!='): To calculate given variables.

\- \*\*Membership Operators\*\* ('in', 'not in'): To confirm subject choices.

\- \*\*Logical Operators\*\* ('and', 'or', 'not'): In study logic and ending logic.

\- \*\*Identity Operators\*\* ('is', 'is not'): Used for honor recognition.

\- \*\*Nested Conditions\*\*: Used in ending results.



\# How to Run Game

1\. Copy or download the repository.

2\. Open the aniyahthompsonn\_assignment\_4.py file in PyCharm



\# Ending Representation

Each ending represents a collection of either the users GPA, study hours, social points, or stress level. Each edning is chosen accordingly and even outputs an invalid statement when none of the conditions apply. 



1\. "Your eligible for honors recognition!" AND "Your hard work paid off! Congratulations!"

2\. "Your academics paid off but you ended up burnt out."

3\. "Unfortunately, you're on academic probation."

4\. "You didn't pass but at least you had fun"

5\. "Semester completed. Lets try better next semester."



\# AI Usage

Throughout this assignment, I used chatgpt to help clarify concepts, errors that came up, and code review. It helped me plan out my game theme in order for it to be created. Other than that all creative decisions, code, and testng was done by me.
